WordPress-Theme-Boilerplate
===========================

A basic foundation for writing WordPress themes using HTML5 and CSS3. Minimal styling is used to make it easier to style for any purpose.

Unit Tests
----------

I've included a file (test-wordpress-theme-boilerplate.php) that contains unit tests for the theme. In order to run the tests you will need to have PHPUnit installed and the WordPress unit test repository checked out into a folder in the theme and setup correctly.

To run the test go to the test framework directory in a terminal emulator and run "phpunit ../test-wordpress-theme-boilerplate.php)". This assumes you have added PHPUnit to your path.
